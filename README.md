# logistics-simulation-logger-for-factorio
Logistics Simulation Logger (LogSim) turns your factory into a measurable system. It logs inventories, machine states, power use, and pollution as time-based data for external analysis. Designed for experimentation, optimization, and logistics education. Data-first, not QoL.
