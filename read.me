# Factorio Simulation Logger

A Factorio 2.x mod focused on logging and observing factory behavior over time.

This mod is not a gameplay or QoL mod. It is intended for:
- system analysis
- experimentation
- logistics and production education
- external, time-based evaluation of factory behavior

## What it does
- Logs inventory changes in chests and buffers
- Tracks machine-level production metrics
- Records power usage and pollution
- Uses periodic snapshots instead of event spam
- Exports analysis-friendly log data

## Scope
This mod intentionally does not provide in-game dashboards or optimization hints.
Visualization and analysis are meant to happen externally.

## Status
Usable, but actively evolving.
Feedback on metrics, performance, and design decisions is welcome.
